This code implements logistic regression from scratch using NumPy to classify two-dimensional data into two classes. It generates a synthetic dataset, trains the model using gradient descent, and predicts class labels using the sigmoid activation function. Finally, it visualizes the decision boundary and prints the model accuracy, showing how logistic regression separates data linearly.
